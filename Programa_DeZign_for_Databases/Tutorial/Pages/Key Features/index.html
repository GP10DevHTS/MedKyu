<h2> Design and maintain your databases with maximum efficiency. DeZign for Databases is an easy-to-use; repository-based data modeling tool that help you design, document and maintain databases for desktop and client/server applications.</h2>
<h2>Visual Data Modeling</h2>
<strong>Entity Relationship Diagramming.</strong>&nbsp;DeZign for Databases uses&nbsp;<a href="http://www.datanamic.com/dezign/erdiagramtool.html">entity relationship diagrams</a>&nbsp;(ERDs) to graphically design databases. In your diagram you can visually make a design using entities, relationships, subcategories, group boxes and text blocks.
<p>Entity symbols are used to define database table structures, including details about columns (attributes), primary keys, null, unique, foreign keys, domains, check constraints, ....</p>
<p>Relationships are drawn between entities and can include a name, abbreviation, description and the cardinalities (zero, one, many, ...). You can create identifying and non-identifying relationships.</p>
<p>The diagram editor user interface fully supports drag-and-drop of entities, relationships, subcategories, group boxes and text blocks. Moving an entity automatically results in a redrawing of your relationship lines.</p>
<p><strong>Industry standard design notations.</strong>&nbsp;You can draw your entity relationship diagram (ERD) based on data modeling notations defined by IDEF1X or Crow's Foot (Information Engineering).&nbsp;<a href="http://www.datanamic.com/dezign/idef1x.html">Read more.</a></p>
<p><strong>Multiple display modes.</strong>&nbsp;DeZign for Databases will display model information at various levels. These display modes can be used at various stages of model development or can be used to convey model information in abstract or in varying depths of detail. You can display an entity with all attributes, keys only or no attributes but only the entity name. You can use indicators for key attributes. Another display option is to show the data types next to the attribute name.</p>
<p><strong>ER-Modeling.</strong>&nbsp;DeZign for Databases supports the ER-modeling techniques. Some advanced features like N:M-relationships (many-to-many relationships) and sub categories (inheritance) are also supported. &quot;DeZign for Databases&quot; will take care of the translation of the ER-Diagram (your database design) to the physical database (your physical tables or your SQL schema).</p>
<p>DeZign for Databases supports the logical and physical data-level from a single specification achieved by using automatic foreign key migration at design-time. A modification to a property of a relationship or to a primary key will automatically affect foreign keys.</p>
<h2>Database Development Lifecycle</h2>
<strong>Reverse engineering.</strong>&nbsp;You can use DeZign for Databases' reverse engineering capabilities to create a data model diagram of your current database system. You can import an existing database by connecting to the database directly or by importing a SQL DDL script. Your complete database will be imported including tables, foreign keys, sequences, triggers, procedures and views. While reverse engineering, the software analyzes the database to find relationships not expressly defined to the database.
<p><strong>Forward engineering.</strong>&nbsp;DeZign for Databases can generate databases directly from your data models (ER-diagrams). For SQL databases, the SQL DDL scripts to create your database will be generated. For non SQL databases, the physical database files will be generated directly. You can control what will be generated. Generate individual parts of your model. Generate tables, foreign keys, indexes, domains, sequences, procedures, triggers and views.</p>
<p><strong>Database/model synchronization</strong>: Our data modeling product offers bi-directional compare and synchronize functionality for all synchronization use cases: model-to-database, model-to-script, database-to-model, script-to-model, model-to-model. When any change is made to either the model or database, DeZign for Databases provides a comprehensive comparison of all differences. Changes can be moved from model-to-database or database-to-model. DeZign for Databases also automatically generates alter scripts to update any database.</p>

</ul>
Please see the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.datanamic.com/dezign/supporteddatabases.html">Supported databases document</a>&nbsp;for an overview of what is supported for each target database.
<p><strong>Switch target database.</strong>&nbsp;You can easily switch to a new target database for your model. DeZign for Databases will automatically translate the data types. For the conversion of the data types, DeZign for Databases uses data type mappings. You can easily change these mappings in the Data type conversion rules editor.</p>
<p><strong>Database-independent models.</strong>&nbsp;Next to models for a specific database, DeZign for Databases supports&nbsp;<a href="http://www.datanamic.com/dezign/databaseindependentmodeling.html">database-independent models</a>. For database-independent models you work with portable data types and select the target DBMS when you generate or alter your database.</p>
<h2>Better Database Designs</h2>
<strong>Model validation.</strong>&nbsp;You can validate a model for errors any time during the design process. During validation, DeZign for Databases checks to make sure the elements in your model are correct and complete.
<p><strong>Automatic foreign key migration.</strong>&nbsp;DeZign for Databases supports the logical and physical data-level from a single specification achieved by using automatic foreign key migration at design-time. A modification to a property of a relationship or to a primary key will automatically affect foreign keys.</p>
<p><strong>Reusable objects.</strong>&nbsp;Domains are reusable user-defined types or &quot;attribute templates&quot; that promote consistent domain definitions. You construct domains as you would attributes, specifying a name, datatype properties, default values and validation rules. Afterwards, you can reuse them in your data model by applying them to attributes and table columns.</p>
<p>Attribute packages are pre-defined, reusable sets of attributes that promote consistent attribute definitions. You construct attribute packages as you would entities, specifying a name, attributes with datatype properties, default values and validation rules. Afterwards, you can reuse these attribute packages in your data model by applying them to entities. You can share attribute packages between data models.</p>
<p><strong>Name templates.</strong>&nbsp;The name templates editor lets you create naming rules for entities, relationships and constraints that can be reused across the model.</p>
<h2>Model Maintenance</h2>
<strong>Diagram management.</strong>&nbsp;DeZign for Databases extends your modeling power with subdiagrams. A project is a set of one or more subdiagrams that contains the specification of an entire data model. You can break a large or complex model into smaller, easier to maintain subdiagrams. Any object can exist in any number of subdiagrams.
<p><strong>Object browser.</strong>&nbsp;The Object Browser provides an additional method for creating and modifying model objects. Rather than presenting a picture of the model in the traditional diagram window manner, the Object Browser provides an organized, ordered view of the model and its contents. You can create, navigate and modify a model in the Object Browser.</p>
<p><strong>To-Do list.</strong>&nbsp;The To-Do list feature allows you to write a note for unfinished actions. You can attach a to-do item to all model objects (entities, relationships, attributes, sequences, triggers, procedures, views). You can print the complete to-do list or export the list to a CSV file.</p>
<h2>Team Work</h2>
<strong>Compare and merge models.</strong>&nbsp;When two or more people work on the same data model, DeZign for Databases has a compare and merge utility for projects. This utility allows developers to compare and merge two versions of the same data model. They can browse and accept or reject any changes for database objects and (sub)diagrams. With the merge projects utility you can manage&nbsp;<strong>parallel development</strong>&nbsp;of models by a team.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.datanamic.com/dezign/compareandmergemodels.html">Read more.</a>
<h2>Version Control</h2>
Using DeZign for Databases, you can save different versions of a model for archiving, comparisons or altering a database purposes. These versions are stored in the project file.
<p><strong>Manage versions.</strong>&nbsp;You can archive your current model, delete versions or edit the version label or the version comments. You can always return to an older version of your data model.</p>
<p><strong>Automatically save versions.</strong>&nbsp;DeZign for Databases can automatically create a version of your data model when you save your project to disc and when you generate a database or alter a database.</p>
<p><strong>Compare versions.</strong>&nbsp;DeZign for Databases offers advanced, bidirectional comparisons between two versions. Changes made to the data model will be made visible and DeZign for Databases can generate intelligent alteration to update your database.</p>
<h2>Reporting</h2>
DeZign for Databases provides flexible, customizable reporting and printing capabilities.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.datanamic.com/dezign/generatingdocumentation.html">Read more.</a>
<p><strong>HTML, MS Word and PDF reports.</strong>&nbsp;DeZign for Databases enables reporting and documentation of designs through generation of HTML, MS Word and PDF formatted reports for easy deployment of design information. Several reports with different levels of detail can be generated. Optionally the diagram can be inserted as a picture.</p>
<p><strong>Export diagram as image.</strong>&nbsp;The diagram itself can be printed or exported as a bitmap, jpeg-image, gif-image or windows metafile.&nbsp;</p>
